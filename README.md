# TextEditor

A basic desktop text editor written in Java.

Running the program opens a window with a text area.
There is a file menu from where a file can be selected
from the file system. If a file is entered that doesn't
exist, it is created. Newly created files are blank,
while opening an existing file will display its contents
in the text area. The text area can be modified.
Any changes to the text area will not be saved immediately,
and this will be indicated by an asterisk in the title bar.
The file can be saved through the file menu, or Ctrl+S.
A file can be opened or created with Ctrl+O.
